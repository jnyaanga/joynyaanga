# Construct main column, side column and additional page from features
# Every column and page may include any features. Some features are
# created using generic widgets and you can add easily new features,
# as long as an existing widget can render it as you like.
#
# Common keys:
#   feature: name of the feature. For generic features, this is also the root key in the yaml file.
#   title: string rendered as the header of the element. Can be disabled with an empty string.
#   collection: the base name of the yaml file containing the data. Defaults to "features".
#   widget: `layout/partials/section-<widget>.html` used to render this element.
#
# Common widgets:
#
#   details-list:
#     Used by default, if section-<feature>.html doesn't exists.
#
#     Expects data in format (in yaml file):
#       title: the title string
#       subtitle: string rendered under title. E.g., company for projects, certificate authority etc.
#       date: date string, e.g., when a certificate was given
#       details: a text in markdown.
#       link: url where the title will link to
#       links: list of links rendered as a bullet list below details
#         prefix: a string before the link
#         title: a string inside the link
#         url: the destination of the link
#         icon: the icon string, e.g., "fas fa-cloud". rendered inside link and after title.
