The environment often varies in quality over space and time, leaving generations of individuals to face demanding and dynamic conditions. Organisms, however, are equipped with machinery for altering their phenotypes to cope with environmental variation. Developing animals use this machinery to produce phenotypes best suited for conditions experienced in adulthood [[1]]( https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00720). In this way, environmental heterogeneity can drive the expansion of phenotypes and developmental strategies that maximize the match of a phenotype to an environment. 
  
This phenomenon where an individual can generate multiple phenotypes based on external conditions is called **phenotypic plasticity**, and is often thought to be under genetic control. Individuals with particular genetic backgrounds may be more sensitive to shifts in environmental conditions [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.02070). Several studies have considered how different sources of environmental variation can modulate genome activity in many systems. However, deciphering the genetic basis of phenotypically plastic traits is challenging as little is known about the genetic architecture underlying plastic responses to the environment. To identify genomic regions contributing to environmental sensitivity, we must first uncover how plasticity differs among genotypes and the effects of this in diverse environments.
