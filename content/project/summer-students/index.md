During the summer of 2020, I developed and mentored 6 undergraduate/high school students through a remote computational project. Through this experience, students were introduced to both image processing and R programming. Ultimately this work contributed to a [publication](/publication/growth/).

The following are lessons used to introduce various R packages & functions:
