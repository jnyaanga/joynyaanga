I am a **computational scientist** with a passion for leveraging bioinformatics, data science, and reproducible programming to **drive innovative research and therapeutic advancements**. My expertise spans multi-omics data analysis, statistical modeling, and bioinformatics pipeline development, enabling me to extract meaningful insights from complex biological datasets.
  
My **Ph.D. research** at **Northwestern University** focused on genetic diversity and its influence on growth and development, where I developed a strong foundation in statistical analysis, data visualization, and computational modeling. Through this work, I became an avid user of R and Python, using these tools to perform rigorous analyses and generate impactful scientific insights.
  
I have since applied my expertise across multiple industries, including **healthcare, clinical research, and biotech startups**. As a Senior Bioinformatician at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, I contributed to clinical and translational research, developing bioinformatics solutions to support diagnostic assessments and pediatric disease research. In this role, I expanded my skill set to include Bash and Nextflow, allowing me to build and maintain scalable, reproducible pipelines for analyzing genomic and transcriptomic data.
  
Currently, as a **Data Scientist II** at **Evozyne**, a pre-clinical stage biotech startup, I integrate bioinformatics and computational modeling to support therapeutic discovery in gene editing and protein engineering. I thrive in fast-paced, interdisciplinary environments, where adaptability and collaboration are essential for solving complex biological problems.
  
At the core of my work is a **deep enthusiasm for bridging science, data, and strategy**—translating raw biological data into actionable insights that drive scientific innovation.
