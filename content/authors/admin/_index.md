I completed my PhD at **Northwestern University** studying the impact of genetic diversity on animal growth and development. 
Now, I work as a Senior Bioinformatician at **Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago** supporting clinical and research analysis needs.
My professional interests lie in leveraging analytical thinking and reproducible programming to solve complex problems. 

Throughout my PhD I was an avid user of the R programming language. I used R in all aspects of my research 
from performing statistical analyses, creating detailed visualizations, to generating comprehensive reports. 
Now, I use bash and Nextflow extensively to organize and analyze genomic data.
When I'm not coding I enjoy all forms of fiction, and exploring the gorgeous city of Chicago.

Welcome to my [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)-powered website! I'm hoping to share more about my research,
exciting projects I've been a part of, and any useful tidbits I come across. Please have a look around!
