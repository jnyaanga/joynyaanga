I recently completed my PhD at **Northwestern University** studying the impact of 
genetic diversity on animal growth and development. I am currently a Bioinformatician 
in the Andersen Lab at Northwestern University. My professional interests lie in 
leveraging analytical thinking and reproducible programming to solve complex problems. 

I was first introduced to the wonderful world of code 5 years ago. Since then I've added 
Python, R, bash, and SQL to my repertoire. I am currently an avid user of the R programming language. 
I use R in all aspects of my research from performing statistical analyses, creating detailed visualizations,
to generating comprehensive reports. When I'm not coding I enjoy all forms of fiction (book and podcast recs welcome!), 
and exploring the gorgeous city of Chicago.

Welcome to my [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)-powered website! I'm hoping to share more about my research,
exciting projects I've been a part of, and any useful tidbits I come across. Please have a look around!
