I completed my PhD at **Northwestern University** studying the impact of genetic diversity on animal growth and development. 
Now, I work as a Senior Bioinformatician at **Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago** performing clinical and research bioinformatic analysis. 
My professional interests lie in leveraging analytical thinking and reproducible programming to solve complex problems. 

Throughout my PhD I was an avid user of the R programming language. I used R in all aspects of my research 
from performing statistical analyses, creating detailed visualizations, to generating comprehensive reports. 
Now, I use bash and Nextflow extensively to build and maintain pipelines that organize and analyze genomic data.
