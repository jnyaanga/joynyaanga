I am a PhD candidate at **Northwestern University** studying the impact of diet perturbation and 
genetic diversity on animal growth and development. My professional interests lie in leveraging 
analytical thinking and reproducible programming to solve complex problems.

I am an avid user of the R programming language. I use R in all aspects of my research from 
performing statistical analyses, creating detailed visualizations, to generating comprehensive reports.
When I'm not coding I enjoy all forms of fiction (book and podcast recs welcome!), and 
exploring the gorgeous city of Chicago.

Welcome to my [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)-powered website! I'm hoping to share more about my research,
exciting projects I've been a part of, and any useful tidbits I come across. Please have a look around!
