I recently completed my PhD at **Northwestern University** studying the impact of genetic diversity on animal growth and development. 
I have since transitioned to a position as a Bioinformatician in the [Andersen Lab](https://andersenlab.org/) where I handle the 
analysis and organization of all data releases for the _C. elegans_ Natural Diversity Resource ([CeNDR](https://elegansvariation.org)).
My professional interests lie in leveraging analytical thinking and reproducible programming to solve complex problems. 

I was first introduced to the wonderful world of programming five years ago. Throughout my PhD I was an avid user of the R programming language. 
I used R in all aspects of my research from performing statistical analyses, creating detailed visualizations, to generating comprehensive reports. 
Now, I use bash and Nextflow extensively to organize and analyze whole-genome sequence data.
When I'm not coding I enjoy all forms of fiction (book and podcast recs welcome!), and exploring the gorgeous city of Chicago.

Welcome to my [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)-powered website! I'm hoping to share more about my research,
exciting projects I've been a part of, and any useful tidbits I come across. Please have a look around!
