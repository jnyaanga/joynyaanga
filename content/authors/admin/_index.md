# About me

I am a PhD candidate at **Northwestern University** studying organismal growth and development. My professional interests
lie in deciphering large data structures through reproducible and readable programming to gain novel insights.

I am an avid user of the R programming language. I enjoy using R in all aspects of my research from performing statistical analyses,
creating detailed visualizations, and generating comprehensive reports. 

Welcome to my [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)-powered website! I'm hoping to share more about my research,
exciting projects I've been a part of, and any useful tidbits I come across. Please have a look around!
