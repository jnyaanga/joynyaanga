abstract: Growth rate and body size are complex traits that contribute to the fitness of organisms. The identification of loci that underlie differences in these traits provides insights into the genetic contributions to development. Leveraging *Caenorhabditis elegans* as a tractable metazoan model for quantitative genetics, we can identify genomic regions that underlie differences in growth. We measured post-embryonic growth of the laboratory-adapted wild-type strain (N2) and a wild strain from Hawaii (CB4856), and found differences in body size. Using linkage mapping, we identified three distinct quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes IV, V, and X that are associated with variation in body size. We further examined these size-associated QTL using chromosome substitution strains and near-isogenic lines, and validated the chromosome X QTL. Additionally, we generated a list of candidate genes for the chromosome X QTL. These genes could potentially contribute to differences in animal growth and should be evaluated in subsequent studies. Our work reveals the genetic architecture underlying animal growth variation and highlights the genetic complexity of body size in *C. elegans* natural populations.
